Back then, we handled security flaws in our packages, and we needed to know the state of our products. We started using “Getting Things Done” (GTD), a methodology developed by David Allen. Using the GTD workflow system, we set the foundation for building the workflow in Product Security for handling vulnerabilities. The idea was to track the issues; we wanted to give them all an ID for clarity. We decided to invest our time in CVEs fully as a means to do so. It was the right way to have an industry-wide naming system for vulnerabilities."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"Red Hat Product Security was one of the initial organizations that started assigning CVEs for all vulnerabilities and we assign CVEs early in the process publicly. This allowed us to track an issue right through, from identification, to fix. It also helped other Linux distributions to have a common designation for a flaw, even though we all ship different versions and upstream versions of each package. Even in case of a backport, the CVE numbering schema fits backport fixes, and we could discuss the same issue. This is an open-source community approach that we fully believe in, and it is for the community that we maintain this approach to identification."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"During this time, we assigned CVE IDs alongside CVE Program analysts on the oss-security mailing list where open source projects would request them (for example, <a target=\'_blank\' href=\'https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/07/24/5\'>https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/07/24/5</a>).

We contributed to each one of these efforts, including assisting with pen testing and the early design of the CVE Services API.

Often the decision is to defer fixing until later, only to be overcome by events or forgotten.” Worse, “vulnerability management programs rely too heavily on the CVSS Base score, produced by vendors and the National Vulnerability Database, in determining the severity and impact of the vulnerability on their operational practices. Vulnerability Management teams often rely solely on the CVSS score assigned to a specific CVE to decide whether or not to fix the CVE in their environment.”"},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"To improve this, Kent recommends the use of the <a href=\'https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog\' target=\'_blank\'>Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)</a> catalog as a way to help address the issue: “The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recently ordered federal agencies to patch a set of vulnerabilities that were just added to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. Of the six vulnerabilities recently added to the KEV, four had CVEs assigned in 2013 and one in 2010. If you are one of the organizations that bases their patching decisions on CVSS scores, do yourself a favor, subscribe to the KEV updates and add fixing those listed in the KEV catalog a priority in your vulnerability management process. It will be a positive step in the right direction.”"},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"Kent concludes the article by stating: “It is time we reexamine each of our vulnerability management programs to assure we are not letting impactful and known CVEs continue to exist in our networks long past the time that vendor fixes are available.”"},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"Read the complete article at <a href=\'https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/ancient-cves-can-cause-you-problems.html\' target=\'_blank\'>https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/ancient-cves-can-cause-you-problems.html</a>."}]},{"id":139,"newsType":"news","title":"KrakenD Added as CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)","date":"2022-10-25","description":[{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"<a href=\'/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/KrakenD\'>KrakenD, S.L.</a> is now a <a href=\'/ResourcesSupport/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryCNA\'>CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)</a> for KrakenD EE, KrakenD CE, and Lura issues only."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"To date, <a href=\'/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners\'>250</a> organizations from <a href=\'/ProgramOrganization/CNAs\'>35</a> countries have partnered with the CVE Program.

When a vulnerability does not require customer action, issuing a CVE generates a high volume of unactionable noise for users instead of a high-fidelity signal that they can act upon. At the request of participating cloud service providers (CSPs), the Board changed the CVE Program rules over two years ago, to enable CVE ID assignment and record publication for vulnerabilities affecting cloud services."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"For example, consider a SQL injection discovered in a content management system hosted as a cloud service.

A CNA-LR may assume responsibility for assigning a CVE ID and publishing the associated CVE Record based on policies defined by the CVE Program."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"The Board chose to define the rules for vulnerabilities affecting cloud services because cloud solutions are intrinsically different from on-prem solutions."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"CVE IDs assigned to vulnerabilities in traditional or on-prem software can be scrutinized by the community based on the information about affected versions and public references available.

If a cloud vulnerability has not yet been fixed, there may often be no way for a third party to test for its existence without risking disruption of production services or violating terms of use of the service. Similarly, if a cloud vulnerability has been fully fixed, then there also may be no way for a third party to verify it existed."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"Due to these reasons, the CVE Board decided to strike a balance to leave the assignment of CVE IDs to cloud vulnerabilities to the judgment of the CSP.

But let us start at the true beginning: <a href=\'/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/VulDB\'>VulDB</a> launched in 1997. It was a different time back then. When people were talking about vulnerabilities or exploits, they were talking about products: “Did you hear about the new wu-ftpd exploit?” Identifying issues was somehow easier because there were not that many of them, especially not the ones that really drew interest by attackers. If there was potential confusion, people were referring to version numbers of affected products or mentioned technical details such as vulnerable files or exploited functions."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"When CVE was introduced in 1999, I was personally very skeptical. It sounded like a good idea, but I was doubtful that the program would be able to reach the level of technical flexibility and professionalism that would be required to add a sustainable benefit to the industry. I must admit, I was wrong to a large degree."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"<h4>Extended Coverage</h4>"},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"Over the years, CVE made a lot of things easier for us. We are a vulnerability database with a scope that is different than vendor CNAs or vulnerability catalogs covering specific product types. We add everything that can be exploited in software or hardware. We are very close to hosting 200,000 entries in our database."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"Even though we share a very similar philosophy to the CVE Program, our approach slightly differs. For example, we also accept submissions for vulnerabilities in malware. That is because we think that on top of the malicious code, additional attack surfaces are introduced, which increases the risk and people should know about this. You would be surprised how much malware comes with buffer overflows, directory traversal possibilities, and permission issues."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"<h4>Duplicate Handling</h4>"},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"Due to our extended coverage, our main challenge is handling and preventing duplicates. We are very proud to have had just a handful of such duplicates in the last 25 years. In these rare cases, we use merge and forward capabilities to redirect users to the right entries. All edits are documented in a commit history, rendering changes very transparent."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"Dealing with potential duplicates requires a lot of effort to verify, synchronize, and align vulnerability details. Our data team monitors thousands of sources 24/7. As soon as a new vulnerability disclosure is suspected, it is analyzed for eligibility."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"At the beginning, CVE used the now obsolete CAN tag (“candidate”) to deal with new entries. We do not use such a tagging, but we do add a confidence level to every commit to help users put data into quality context. Duplicate detection became harder, again, because there are a lot of new vulnerabilities published nowadays (approximately 76 per day in 2022, compared to 40 in 2016) and many more communication channels available. In earlier days, reading mailing lists and collecting vendor advisories was enough. Today, monitoring code repositories, social media, and darknet marketplaces are even more important, especially if you want to cover zero-day vulnerabilities."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"<h4>Why We Joined the CVE Program</h4>"},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"For many years, colleagues and customers were approaching us and asked why we are not supporting the CVE Program or even becoming a CNA ourselves. We are working with CVE data daily and are aware of the importance of the program for the cybersecurity industry, as well as the demanding requirements that come with such importance."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"In 2021, we decided to contact the CVE Program to discuss possibilities of a collaboration. It was very important for us to remain independent while also being a CNA. As defined in the <i><a href=\'/ResourcesSupport/AllResources/CNARules\'>CNA Rules</a></i>, every CNA requires a specific scope. For VulDB to become a CNA, our scope needed to be broader than the CNA Rules currently defines. We discussed this issue with the CVE Program and were able to agree upon a product-independent scope. Primarily, we will assign CVEs for products not covered by other CNAs, but we are also allowed to negotiate vulnerability processing with other CNAs. Security researchers appreciate this possibility.<strong>*</strong>"},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"<h4>The Importance of Vulnerability Management</h4>"},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"<a href=\'/ResourcesSupport/AllResources/CNARules#section_7-2_how_many_vulnerabilities\'>CNA Rule 7.2, “How Many Vulnerabilities?</a>”, defines a clear requirement for splitting and merging entries. Our own philosophy differs slightly. Not much, but enough to add another level of complexity for our data team. If there is one CVE, we might have to split it into multiple entries in VulDB or there are several CVEs available for a single entry."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"Occasionally, customers want to understand the reason why we split or merge entries.  We enjoy these exchanges of the philosophical nature of vulnerabilities. There is a lot of room for ideas that can enrich and improve our industry. Some examples are product assignments, version handling, risk ratings, and vulnerability class definitions, to just name a few. Projects like <a href=\'https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe\' target=\'_blank\'>CPE</a>, <a href=\'https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document\' target=\'_blank\'>CVSS</a>, <a href=\'https://cwe.mitre.org/\' target=\'_blank\'>CWE</a>, and <a href=\'https://attack.mitre.org/\' target=\'_blank\'>ATT&CK</a> took the role of CVE in their respective fields. They are often not perfect solutions, but do help to introduce a common language."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"Unfortunately, it is often forgotten that vulnerability management is one of the main pillars of cyber security. Perhaps because for some, it might not spark the glamorous appeal of new topics like artificial intelligence and blockchain, but for us it does. Without vulnerability management, there will be no new secure technologies."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"<h4>Conclusion</h4>"},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"Our dedicated CNA team supports our data team in processing new submissions and coordinating CVE disclosures. This re-introduced the early challenges of duplicate detection before the CVE era. But we profit from a lot of experience and optimized processes compiled over decades. We are very confident and happy to be a part of something important like the CVE Program."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"<strong>*</strong> <i>This paragraph was updated on July 12, 2022 to better clarify VulDB’s CNA scope.

Especially in the industrial world, cybersecurity has gained increasingly more relevance for hardware, firmware, and software over the past years. This blog article will tell our story from establishing a company-wide Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) to becoming an industrial <a href=\'/ResourcesSupport/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryCNA\'>CNA</a>."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"More than a decade ago, in the earliest days of <a target=\'_blank\' href=\'https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/services/cert.html\'>Siemens ProductCERT</a>, reported vulnerabilities were an exceptional and exciting experience. At that time, vulnerabilities were often an issue of IT and software vendors, but rarely affected industrial vendors like Siemens. The entire Operational Technologies (OT) world was still considering industrial environments as separated infrastructures, where vulnerabilities might not be exploited due to strong firewalls around factories\' infrastructure. In addition, lifetimes of industrial devices were often 20+ years, thus some devices were used over incredible time frames - viewed from an IT perspective. This has fundamentally changed over the last years; <i>digitalization</i> has become not just a buzzword, but now more and more, a reality. OT is now closely connected to external services and networks, and industrial equipment has become powerful devices with major parts in software. Thus, in OT environments, it was vital to adopt widely used software paradigms like vulnerability handling or publishing advisories to make our customers aware of fixed vulnerabilities. Acting as a central PSIRT for all Siemens products, we supported all of our businesses in this changing world, which is a quite challenging task considering the broadness of the Siemens product portfolio and the impressive organizational size of our globally acting company."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"We started with the publication of our first advisories in 2011 on our <a target=\'_blank\' href=\'https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/services/cert.html\'>ProductCERT web page</a>, where we already used standards like CVE and <a target=\'_blank\' href=\'https://www.first.org/cvss/\'>Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)</a> to offer valuable vulnerability information to our customers. Unlike the usual way in IT, we published our advisories in PDF format, which could be printed and read by OT staff, and later we also offered other formats like HTML and CVRF. At that initial time, we received most reports via other CERTs, and we saw quite fast, that we needed to obtain our CVE numbers directly from MITRE for practical reasons. Over the years we increased steadily the number of published advisories and became more and more transparent on our fixed vulnerabilities. We became known to the <a target=\'_blank\' href=\'https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/services/cert/hall-of-thanks.html\'>researchers</a> and got more vulnerability reports from them directly. In 2017, we partnered with the CVE Program as a <a href=\'/ResourcesSupport/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryCNA\'>CNA</a> and we were happy that we then were able to have a much easier handling of those CVE number bands, allowing us to increase automation on the advisories as well. At the end of 2018, we introduced our <a target=\'_blank\' href=\'https://new.siemens.com/global/en/company/stories/research-technologies/cybersecurity/rhythm-for-security.html\'>advisory day</a>, and since then all advisories (with some exceptions of a few out-of-band publications) were issued in a regular monthly cycle. This allows our customers to apply all Siemens patches in the same maintenance window as other major software vendors. Considering the variety of our businesses, this was an enormous challenge and was only possible with the great support of our product development teams."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"With increasingly more software in our industrial devices and with a huge effort in cybersecurity activities within our development departments, the number of published vulnerabilities will raise further on our ongoing transition journey to digitalization. Openness and transparency with vulnerability disclosures increases customer trust, and thus ProductCERT supports this heavily by comprehensive automation of our vulnerability handling and advisory publishing processes as well as by working on easier integration of our advisory information into our customers’ processes like the emerging <a target=\'_blank\' href=\'https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=csaf\'>Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) format</a>. In 2021, the <a target=\'_blank\' href=\'https://www.cisa.gov/ics\'>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</a> was designated a CVE Program Top-Level Root for industrial control systems and medical device vendors, where we fit very well with our product portfolio."},{"contentnewsType":"paragraph","content":"The collaboration with the CVE Program in the past decade helped us much to establish the processes and standards on company-scale for providing professional vulnerability handling as a large-scale industrial vendor. Our advisories and contained standards like CVE, <a target=\'_blank\' href=\'https://www.first.org/cvss/\'>CVSS</a>, and <a target=\'_blank\' href=\'https://cwe.mitre.org/\'>Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE™)</a> are now well-known to the cybersecurity community, within Siemens, and are made available to our customers via our published advisories.

CVEs with candidate status used the CAN-prefix (e.g., &quot;CAN-1999-0067&quot;), while CVEs with entry status used the CVE-prefix (e.g., &quot;CVE-1999-0067&quot;). This meant that the individual identifier numbers themselves would need to be changed once a candidate had been updated to entry status, placing a significant burden on the numerous vendors and organizations around the world that would in turn need to update their tools and processes to accommodate the replacement identifier numbers. This became especially burdensome as the volume of vulnerabilities being discovered and added to the CVE List increased each year (CVE Records are now added to the CVE website on a daily basis).

The CVE Program is overseen by the <a href=\'/ProgramOrganization/Board\'>CVE Board</a> (hereinafter the Board).

Participation in this program is voluntary, and the benefits of participation include the ability to publicly disclose a vulnerability with an already assigned CVE ID, the ability to control the disclosure of vulnerability information without pre-publishing, and notification of vulnerabilities in products within a CNA’s scope by researchers who request a CVE ID from them."],"subSubSections":[]},{"subSectionId":"section_1-2_cna_program_structure","subSectionTitle":"CNA Program Structure","subSectionParagraphs":["As the CNA Program has evolved and the number of CNAs has increased, it has become necessary to categorize CNAs into the four following categories:</p><ol><li>Sub-CNA</li><li>Root</li><li>Top-Level Root</li><li>CNA of Last Resort (CNA-LR)</li></ol><p><strong>Sub-CNAs</strong> are the most common and basic level of CNA. Each Sub-CNA assigns CVE IDs for vulnerabilities in their own products or their domain of responsibility, hereinafter referred to as scope, and submits the vulnerability information to the CVE List when they make the vulnerability public. Sub-CNAs are administered and mentored by Roots.","<strong>Root</strong> manages a group of Sub-CNAs within a given domain or community, and train and admit new Sub-CNAs, CNA-LRs, and Roots within that domain or community.","At the top of the CNA hierarchy are the <strong>Top-Level Roots</strong>, which is a special type of Root that oversees their CNA hierarchy.","Since the Sub-CNAs administered by a Root may not cover all of the vulnerabilities within that Root\'s scope, each Root is responsible for assigning a <strong>CNA-LR</strong> to fill in the gaps. CNA-LRs also assign CVE IDs, but their scopes cover all vulnerabilities for their Root that are not already covered by one of its Sub-CNAs.","Finally, while not a type of CNA, the <strong>Secretariat</strong> role supports many of the CNA functions (such as providing infrastructure and publishing the CVE List) and therefore is included in this document.","Each of the different types of CNAs, and the Secretariat, are roles that can be fulfilled by any organization that meets the requirements. These roles are not mutually exclusive, and a single organization can fulfill more than one of these roles at the same time. For example, the organization that operates a Root may also choose to act as the CNA-LR for its scope.","<div style=\'float:middle; width:100%; font-size:100%; vertical-align:top; padding-top:10px; padding-left:0px; padding-bottom:5px;\'><div style=\'margin: auto; text-align: center\'><img src=\'/images/CNARules_Federated_CNA_Structure.png\' width=\'656\' height=\'525\' alt=\'Figure 1.

A portion of the gray box in the center of the figure is shaded yellow to indicate that part of that scope has been delegated to a particular Root and its Sub-CNAs.","In cases where requests or issues cannot be resolved by a given CNA, the issues are escalated to the next higher-level Root. Examples of such issues would be a CNA being unresponsive beyond expected timeframes or a disagreement with a CNA over whether or not an issue is a vulnerability. Requests and issues at the Sub-CNA level can be elevated to Roots, and requests and issues at the Roots can be elevated to the Top-Level Root. A Top-Level Root has the right to require remediation or impose sanctions on CNAs (of any type) that do not comply with the CNA Rules; however, Roots are the main enforcement mechanism. Roots are responsible for enforcing the rules within their area of responsibility; the Top-Level Root is the enforcement mechanism of last resort. The Roots have the same level of enforcement ability as the Top-Level Root, including remediation or sanctions, within their areas of responsibility, which enables the federation of the CVE Program by implementing a de-centralized governance approach.","Examples of remediation and sanctions include, but are not limited, to:<ul><li>The development of training, guidance, or implementation materials for use by the CNAs;</li><li>Retraining of CNA staff;</li><li>Additional process documentation and reporting from a CNA;</li><li>Reduction of the number of CVE IDs a CNA has available to assign at a time;</li><li>Rejection of CVE Record submissions; and</li><li>Revocation of CNA status.</li></ul>","The same flow, from Sub-CNAs to Roots to the Top-Level Root, is followed to alert the next higher CNA when CVEs are assigned, or when reporting other programmatic data (see Figure 2, below).
